.. warning:: Use of Claim Done Remover has been found (in rare unlucky cases) to cause the TranscribersOfReddit Discord
             bot (the stats bot) to freeze. I do **NOT** mean the subreddit bot, I only mean the discord one. Again,
             this happens only in rare cases however notice that it *can* happen. Although
             `ToR User Stats <https://timjentzsch.github.io/tor-user-stats/>`__ is better than the discord bot anyways.

**This is an unofficial program and is not officially endorsed by the Transcribers of Reddit**

Claim Done Remover, shortened to CDR, is a program designed for
`r/TranscribersOfReddit <https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit>`__ users to allow them to automatically delete
`claim`, `done` (and anything else) comments after a certain `trigger <mode.html>`_ happens.

This helps avoid cluttering up your Reddit profile history and makes it look cleaner.
